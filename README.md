## Personal Website

My personal website built with Compose Multiplatform web (WASM). Support on browsers is not all there. Specifically browsers that do not have support for Wasm GC will not work (at the moment Safari or any browser on iOS).

For a previous version of the website made using Flutter checkout the [flutter branch](https://github.com/loukwn/loukwn-me/tree/flutter)
